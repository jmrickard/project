# Include custom rewrite rules that should be added to the http server's httpd.conf in this file.
# The order in which rewrite rules are applied affects their behavior, if other rules match the
# same pattern.
# 
# The rules in the Before_Rules section will be included *before* the rules that are written by the toolkit.
# The rules in the After_Rules section will be included *after* the rules that are written by the toolkit.
#
# Typically, it should not be necessary to use the Before_Rules section, as the toolkit already configures
# the rules needed for the operation of i2 Analyze and these should not conflict with custom rules.
#
# If required, the context-root attributes for <wars> in the topology can be referenced with ${contextRoot:War_Name}
# and these will be substituted when the rules are written to the httpd.conf. Otherwise the rules will be written
# exactly as they appear between the !Start_..._Rules! and !End_..._Rules! markers.
#
# Example:
#
# !Start_After_Rules!
# # Redirect from CustomService on /${contextRoot:opal-services-ar} to AnotherCustomService on /MyContextRoot
# RewriteRule ^/${contextRoot:opal-services-ar}/services/CustomService/(\S+) /MyContextRoot/$1/AnotherCustomService [PT]
# !End_After_Rules!
#
# Given the standard context-root for the opal-services-ar war, this would be added to the httpd.conf, after the standard
# rules, as follows:
#
# # Redirect from CustomService on /apollo to AnotherCustomService on /MyContextRoot
# RewriteRule ^/apollo/services/CustomService/(\S+) /MyContextRoot/$1/AnotherCustomService [PT]
